# Arduino-Memory-Reaction-Time
Arduino program and schematic for testing working set memory with different types of characters. Written for Arduino UNO with LCD screen and two buttons.
Used to perform tests on working set memory with varying stimulus length, set size, and character type. 
Prints comma-separated value with stimulus, reaction time in milliseconds, and correctness (e.g. abcdef,1000,1).
